    “I must not take a short little nap. Short little nap is the grind-killer. Short little nap is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my eepy. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the eepy has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
